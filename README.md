## Contributing & Installing

[Node installation instructions]: https://nodejs.org/en/download/

1. Make sure Node is set up.

    Don't have Node? Please follow the [Node installation instructions]

2. Run 'npm install' and wait for the npm package-manager to retrieve and install the dependencies.

3. Run 'npm start' and wait for the web app to compile and start.

4. Git commits must be [clean, atomic,](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) and most importantly, follow the [seven sacred rules](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/#seven-rules).

    If you have a big commit that needs splitting up, you can use `git add --patch` (in short, `git add -p`) to interactively stage [hunks](https://www.bignerdranch.com/blog/using-git-hunks/).

    If you are stuck, please ask for assistance!
